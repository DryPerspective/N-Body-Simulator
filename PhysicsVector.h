* As the name suggests, the PhysicsVector class is used to hold a vector (the mathematical object of a number with direction) and various functions to manipulate it.
* Using the name PhysicsVector rather than Vector to try reduce confusion with the std::vector object included as part of the C++ standard library and used for dynamically sized arrays.
* This class should work for vectors of any dimension, but has more focus on 2D and 3D vectors since they are the overwhelming majority of use cases (plus after dimension 4 there isn't easy letter representation).
* 
* As several vector functions are mathematical nonsense when applied to vectors of differing sizes, this object is templated with each new object being a vector of a particular size.
* This gives compiler-level enforcement of such mathematical rules, with the only clear downside being that it is harder to resize a vector.
