# N-Body-Simulator

## What it is

This project uses the semi-implicit Euler method (also known as the Euler-Cromer method) to simulate N bodies under gravity. The default setup is Earth's solar system, however the planets are read in from the file `config.txt` so it would be entirely possible to simulate any planetary body out there. The result position data of every planet at each time step is written to an output file named `cppOutputFile.csv` from which the data can be read and graphed in an external program.
Some examples of graphs of data generated by the simulation are below:

Graphs in the above image were generated in Qtiplot.

In addition to the planets being simulated, the simulation time step and total simulation length are also defined within `config.txt`. Due to the physics of gravity meaning that every planet in a system has a gravitational effect on every other planet, and the simulating needing to calculate each of these effects, processing time will increase non-linearly with each new planet added.

The main file for this project is `SolarSystem.cpp`

## Notes on the code

This project was written using the C++17 language standard, on Visual Studio for Windows 10. It makes use of several objects introduced in C++17 (`std::string_view`, `std::from_chars`, etc) so will not compile on previous language standards.

As of the latest version, the core vector object used in this simulation is found as PhysicsVector in my [Basic Utilities library](https://github.com/DryPerspective/Basic-Utilities), as it is significantly more optimised than the object originally derived for this project.
