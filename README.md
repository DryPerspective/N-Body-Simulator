# N-Body-Simulator

## What it is

This project uses the semi-implicit Euler method (also known as the Euler-Cromer method) to simulate N bodies under gravity. The default setup is Earth's solar system, however the planets are read in from the file `config.txt` so it would be entirely possible to simulate any planetary body out there. The result position data of every planet at each time step is written to an output file named `cppOutputFile.csv` from which the data can be read and graphed in an external program.
Some examples of graphs of data generated by the simulation are below:

In addition to the planets being simulated, the simulation time step and total simulation length are also defined within `config.txt`.

The main file for this project is `SolarSystem.cpp`

## Notes on the code

This project was written using the C++17 language standard, on Visual Studio for Windows 10. It makes use of several objects introduced in C++17 (`std::string_view`, `std::from_chars`, etc) so will not compile on previous language standards.
